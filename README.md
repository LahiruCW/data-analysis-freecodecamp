# Data Analysis with python.
Data Analysis with python is a certification course offered by Freecodecamp. This course teaches the whole process of Data Analysis that reading data from multiple sources (CSV,SQL,Excel),process that data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The following projects need to complete in this course. This repository contains my solutions for these projects.

### [1. Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](https://github.com/LahiruCW/data-analysis-freecodecamp/tree/main/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator)
Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator is a function that creates using numpy to output the mean, variance and standard deviation of the rows, columns and elements in a 3x3 matrix. 

### [2. Demographic Data Analyzer](https://github.com/LahiruCW/data-analysis-freecodecamp/tree/main/demographic_data_analyzer)
In the demographic data analyzer project, we use pandas on a dataset of demographic data extracted from the 1994 Census database and answer some questions according to the data. The dataset source: Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: the University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

### [3. Medical Data Visualizer](https://github.com/LahiruCW/data-analysis-freecodecamp/tree/main/medical_data_visualizer)
In the medical data visualizer project, we use matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to make calculations and visualizations from medical examination data collected during medical examinations.

### [4. Page View Time Series Visualizer](https://github.com/LahiruCW/data-analysis-freecodecamp/tree/main/page-view-time-series-visualizer)
For this project, we visualized time series data with a line chart, a bar chart and a box plot using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

### [5. Sea Level Predictor.](https://github.com/LahiruCW/data-analysis-freecodecamp/tree/main/sea-level-predictor)
In this project, we analyzed a dataset of the global average sea-level change since 1880. The purpose of this project is to predict the sea-level change through the year 2050.
