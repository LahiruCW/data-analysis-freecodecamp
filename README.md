# Data Analysis with python.
Data Analysis with python is a certification course offered by Freecodecamp. This course teaches the whole process of Data Analysis that reading data from multiple sources (CSV,SQL,Excel),process that data using NumPy and Pandas, and visualize it using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The following projects need to complete in this course. This repository contains my solutions for these projects.
